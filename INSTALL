In order to successfully use the most recent Krusader, you need KDElibs >= 3.4
Required KDE version:
    * Krusader v1.01: KDE 2
    * Krusader v1.02 - 1.40: KDE 3.0 - KDE 3.2
    * Krusader 1.40: prefers KDE 3.2 (otherwise all features will not be
      available)
    * Krusader v1.50 - v1.51: KDE 3.2 - KDE 3.3 (Konfigurator crash on KDE 3.4)
    * Krusader v1.60.0 - v1.70.0: KDE 3.3 - KDE 3.5

      available)
    * Krusader 1.80.0: KDE 3.4 - KDE 3.5
    * Krusader v2.xx.x: KDE 4 - Qt&#8482; 4 The big challenge, a first release
      in 2007
NOTE: there are no installation instructions for KDE4 yet available since at
moment of writing Krusader was not ported yet to KDE4.
Platforms:
    * All POSIX (Linux®/BSD/UNIX®-like OSes), Solaris&#8482;
    * All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD®/NetBSD®/OpenBSD®/Mac® OS)
Krusader uses about 3-4 Mbyte of memory to run and about 15 Mbyte of shared
memory, which is also used by other processes, but this may vary depending on
your platform and configuration. In order to handle archives the archivers must
be configured here.
A package of popular (un)packers, Krusader itself and add-ons can be found on
the Krusader_downloadpage.
For more requirements, see below. Have a look at the FAQ section as well.
Obtaining Krusader
The latest information about Krusader can be found on the Krusader_website .
Krusader Downloads
it is recommended to use the Krusader package that is provided by your
distribution. Distrowatch.com is a great resource to check the availability. If
your distribution does not offer Krusader, please contact the creators of your
distribution and ask them to provide a Krusader package
The latest version, as well as the older versions, can be found on the Krusader
downloadpage and on the Sourceforge_mirrors. It contains the source tarballs,
RPM and DEB packages to whatever distro the Krusader-Krew is using and packages
build by Krusader users and third parties.
Distributions who provide Krusader:
    * SuSE® >= 9.3, Note: please use Krusader-1.60.0 instead of Krusader-1.51
      (might be unstable on SuSE®9.3-KDE3.4).
    * Fedora&#8482; via Fedora&#8482;_Extras # yum install krusader will do the
      job, thanks to Marcin Garski. Red Hat® RPM packages can usually found on
      the Krusader_downloadpage or at dag.wieers.com and Dries_Verachtert_RPM
      Repository .
    * Debian®, on our Krusader_downloadpage you might find more recent DEB
      packages. Note: usually Debian® packages work also on distributions that
      are "based on Debian®", and some of these provide their own
      (incompatible) packages. Ubuntu®/Kubuntu®, Linspire®, Knoppix® 4.x DVD,
      Kanotix®, etc.
    * Mandriva® via the contrib repository # urpmi krusader will do the job,
      Gentoo®, Yoper&#8482;.
    * Arch_Linux®, Frugalware_Linux®, PCLinuxOS®, altlinux®.
    * FreeBSD®, the port is maintained by Heiner_Eichmann.
    * NetBSD®, Lunar_Linux® ,Ark Linux®, OpenLX&#8482;, Source Mage®.
    * Even more distributions can be found with Distrowatch.com.
Use the installation tools included in your distro to install the Krusader
package. You might need an internet connection if Krusader is not included on
the CD or DVD. There are probably other distributions which include Krusader.
If you know of one, please send feedback so that we can include it on the
distrolist.
Others
    * Slackware® tgz binaries can usually be found on the Krusader
      downloadpage. You can also use Portpkg that contains a Krusader
      SlackBuild, # portpkg krusader will do the job.
    * There is a Mac®_OS-X_port with the help of fink , the port is maintained
      by Catalin_Hritcu.
Installation via the klik_protocol
    * klik://krusader downloads Krusader provided by Debian® stable, more
      information is available .
    * klik://krusader-latest downloads the latest stable_Krusader provided by
      the Krusader Krew.
    * klik://krusader-cvs downloads a cvs_snapshot_of_Krusader provided by the
      Krusader Krew.
Search engines
    * You can also find packages on Linux® software archives such as
      freshmeat.net or KDE-APPS.org .
    * If you can notfind a package for your distribution, we recommend
      searching for it with rpmfind, rpmpbone or rpmseek.
If you enjoy using Krusader, we would appreciate it if you went to one of these
sites and rated it.
If you still can not find a package, follow the installation procedure on how
to compile Krusader from source. This very thorough HowTo describes the process
in such detail that even newcomers should not have any problems.
Version Scheme
A new version scheme has been used since Krusader-1.60.0
    * First digit - the major version
    * Second digit(s) - percentage of features completed for this major version
    * Third digit(s) - bugfixes.
In essence, releasing Krusader-1.60.0 means that we believe that Krusader is
about 60% done with all the features we had scheduled for the 1.x.x series.
Series 2.x.x will be KDE 4.x releases. Hopefully, it is easy to understand.
Stable Version
krusader-x.xx.tar.gz
**** Note ****
Krusader is released under the GNU_General_Public_License_(GPL). This means
that THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, even when it
is marked as a stable release.
Development Version (beta release)
krusader-x.xx-betax.tar.gz
Before every stable release we release at least one development version in
order to hunt down the bugs.
**** Warning ****
These releases are beta releases and will probably contain some bugs.
**** Note ****
If you are using a development or CVS version, it is possible that the latest
new features are not yet in the "The Krusader Handbook". Please read the
ChangeLog file online or in the Krusader sources to find out more about the new
features. For a brief description, please read the CVSNEWS file online or in
the Krusader sources. User_feedback and Bug_reports are always welcome!
The beta release has 3 goals:
    * Apply a feature-freeze until the stable is released, only bugs will be
      fixed. New features have to wait until the stable is released.
    * Obtain feedback from Krusader users so that we can fix the bugs.
    * Give translators time to update the translations for the coming stable.
      Please read the i18n_page.
CVS Builds
krusader-cvs-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
**** Warning ****
These builds are untested and come without any warranty. They may contain
bugfixes, new features, or even new bugs.
We provide daily snapshots of Krusader's CVS version. For those who are
interested, the nightly tarball can be found on the Krusader's_Cutting_Edge
page. Depending on the stage of development, this version will either be stable
or unstable. Just before a stable release, the CVS version is almost stable.
After a stable release new features will be committed into CVS, which might
lead to the appearance of bugs. In some rare cases, the build will not even
compile if we make a mistake. In that case we try to fix the error as soon as
possible.
Krusader provides 2 nightly snapshots:
   1. krusader-cvs-yyyymmdd.tar.gz: make -f Makefile.cvs must be run before the
      ./configure script is available.
   2. krusader-cvs2-yyyymmdd.tar.gz: for users who have problems with the make
      -f Makefile.cvs command, we have already done this for you and the ./
      configure script is included in the tarball. This tarball is a bit bigger
      than the first one.
check out from CVS. Krusader can be checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS
with the following instruction set. The module you wish to check out must be
specified as the module name. When prompted for a password for anonymous, press
the Enter key.
Currently, there are two module options:
    * krusader_kde2: the KDE2 branch, stable but it is basically v1.01 and
      there are no planned changes
    * krusader_kde3: the KDE3 branch that we currently use
To check out Krusader from CVS:
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@krusader.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/krusader login
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@krusader.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/krusader
co krusader_kde3
(note: updates from within the modules directory do not need the -d parameter)
If you want to check out a specific version of Krusader from CVS (e.g.
Krusader-1.60.0) :
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@krusader.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/krusader
co -rversion_1_60_0 krusader_kde3
If you want to check out a specific date of Krusader from CVS (e.g. Krusader-
2006-10-29) :
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@krusader.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/krusader
co -D2006-10-29 krusader_kde3
Mostly being Gentoo® users, we provide a Gentoo®_Live_Ebuild for all those who
want to stay on the bleeding edge of file management and do not want to miss
the advantages of portage. Please take a look at our Krusader's_Cutting_Edge
page for more installation details.
We also provide ViewCVS to browse the CVS repository.
Subversion
Subversion will probably be used for the Krusader 2.x series for KDE4. it is
also possible to Browse_the_Subversion_Repository.
To check out the latest Krusader 1.x for KDE 3 from SVN: (NOTE: at moment of
writing it is recommend to use CVS for krusader_kde3, since krusader_kde3 is
developed in CVS and not in SVN)
$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/krusader/trunk/krusader_kde3
To check out the latest Krusader 2.x for KDE 4 from SVN: (NOTE: not yet
available at moment of writing)
$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/krusader/trunk/krusader_kde4
Older Releases
If you are looking for older releases we recommend the Sourceforge_mirrors,
available from our project page.
Compiling and Installing
Compiling Krusader. What now?
Check the environment variables KDEDIR_-_QTDIR.
To compile and install Krusader on your system, type the following in the base
directory of the Krusader package:
      $ ./configure
      $ make
      $ su -c 'make install'
If you install a CVS or beta version and if Krusader was previously installed
on your computer, then you should delete the krusaderui.rc file in your home
directory to activate the new menu entries $ rm ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/
krusaderui.rc , click here for more info.
Since Krusader uses autoconf and automake you should have no trouble compiling
it. If you run into problems, read the detailed installation instructions
below.
Quickstart Installation Tutorial
Debian
These instructions should work as well on Debian® based distributions like:
Ubuntu®, Kubuntu®, Linspire®, Kanotix®, ...
Add the next lines in the ~/.bashrc configuration file
export QTDIR=/usr
export KDEDIR=/usr
export export KDEDIRS=/opt/krusader:/usr
Install the build_dependencies for Krusader
# apt-get build-dep krusader
Download the Krusader sourcecode, unpack and enter the krusader_kde3 directory.
The next command will create ./configure
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
NOTE: you might need to upgrade automake and/or autoconf, if an error message
appears.
Install Krusader in the /opt directory to not overwrite the official Debian®
binary /usr/bin/krusader, so that krusader will run the official Debian®
package and /opt/bin/krusader runs the compiled version. It's recommended to
use enable the full debug, so that you can possible problems at us. Run
configure.
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/krusader --enable-debug=full
Compile Krusader
$ make
Install Krusader
$ su -c "make install"
/opt/bin/krusader runs the compiled Krusader version.
SuSE
Install the build_dependencies for Krusader
Download the Krusader sourcecode, unpack and enter the krusader_kde3 directory.
Now you can compile and install Krusader
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/krusader --enable-debug=full
$ make
$ su -c "make install"
For other Linuxes
Ofcource it's impossible to cover all Linuxes, but here are the general
installation instructions.
Usually ./configure --prefix=/usr should be used, though options like /opt/
krusader are usually better so that you don't overwrite files that are
installed by your package managment system. Please don't use the /usr/local
directory as it simply won't work.
Install the build_dependencies for Krusader
Download the Krusader sourcecode, unpack and enter the krusader_kde3 directory.
Now you can compile and install Krusader
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ su -c "make install"
Detailed Installation Tutorial
The next section will explain how to install Krusader step by step. Questions
about the installation process have been asked many times and especially users
new to Linux® often have problems compiling software from source. Therefore, we
are trying to keep the explanations as detailed as possible even if they are
mostly not Krusader specific. Experienced users may easily skip most of the
steps.
Unfortunately, because not all Linux® distributions follow the Filesystem
Hierarchy_Standard_(FHS) it is impossible to write a tutorial that would cover
all circumstances. However, these guidelines will help you in the right
direction.
**** Note ****
If you encountered problems, please read first this installation procedure and
the FAQ. If the problem persists, use the help_request to ask for help.
   1. Install all packages and libraries that are needed for the compilation,
      please read the FAQ.
      **** Tip ****
      If you install Kdevelop, (almost) everything that you need to compile
      Krusader will be installed on your computer. However, if you are not a
      developer, please follow the instructions and do not use Kdevelop to
      compile Krusader.
   2. Open your favourite terminal emulator (e.g. Konsole).
   3. We recommend you create a separate directory to keep all the sources you
      compile in. This way you will have a better overview of the installed
      programs and it will be easier to uninstall them later.
      $ mkdir ~/source
      The chosen directory is just an example, any other will work.
   4. Copy the sources to the ~/source directory and unpack them.
      $ cp /"your_dir" /krusader-x.xx.tar.gz ~/source
      $ cd ~/source
      $ tar -xzvfkrusader-x.xx.tar.gz
   5. Optional step: if you wish you can delete the tarball at this point as it
      is no longer needed.
      $ rm krusader-x.xx.tar.gz
   6. Change to the directory containing the sources.
      $ cd krusader-x.xx
   7. Check the environment variables QTDIRand KDEDIR. Krusader's ./configure
      script needs to know where the Qt&#8482; and KDE directories are.
      QTDIR: <path to your Qt installation> e.g. /usr/lib/qt3 or /usr/qt3
      KDEDIR: <path to your KDE installation> e.g. /usr or /opt/kde3
      Normally your distribution will set them for you, but experience has
      shown that some do not. You can easily check the values with the echo
      command.
      $ echo $QTDIR/usr/lib/qt3
                        $ echo $KDEDIR/usr
      If both commands give an output, the enviroment variables are set (the
      above example are the settings of Mandriva®-Linux®). In case you receive
      empty lines, the variables are not set and you have to set them manually.
      If you do not know what to set the variables to, or if you want to check
      if the variables are correctly set, ask your distributor or use the find
      command.
      $ find /usr /opt -name qtconfig -type f 2>/dev/null
      /usr/lib/qt3/bin/qtconfig
      $ find /usr /opt -name kdeinit -type f 2>/dev/null
      /usr/bin/kdeinit
      In this case /usr/lib/qt3 is your QTDIR and /usr is your KDEDIR. The
      installed binaries will go to /usr/bin. Now we will set the enviroment
      variables with the export command.
      $ export QTDIR=<replace with your QTDIR>
      $ export KDEDIR=<replace with your KDEDIR>
      **** Note ****
      These enviroment variables are only set for the lifetime of your current
      shell. When you close your terminal and open a new one they will be gone.
      Assuming Krusader is not the only Qt&#8482;/KDE program you want to
      compile, we recommend to make these settings permanent (e.g. append both
      export commands to your /etc/profile) file.
      If you can notdetermine your KDEDIR, kde-config --prefix might help you.
   8. If you have downloaded a stable version "krusader-x.xx.tar.gz" or a beta
      version "krusader-x.xx-betax.tar.gz", you can skip this step. In this
      case the ./configure script is provided.
      If you have downloaded a CVS build or nightly tarball "krusader-cvs-yyyy-
      mm-dd.tar.gz"", you will have to run the following command to create the
      ./configure script:
      $ make -fMakefile.cvs
      If everything is OK you will see the following output on your screen:
      $ make -f Makefile.cvs
      This Makefile is only for the CVS repository
      This will be deleted before making the distribution
      *** Creating acinclude.m4
      *** Creating list of subdirectories
      *** Creating configure.in
      *** Creating aclocal.m4
      *** Creating configure
      *** Creating config.h template
      *** Creating Makefile templates
      *** Postprocessing Makefile templates
      *** Creating date/time stamp
      *** Finished
      Don't forget to run ./configure
      If you haven't done so in a while, run ./configure --help
      $
      **** Note ****
      You will need to have autoconf 2.52, 2.53 or 2.54 and automake 1.6 (or
      higher) to run the make -f Makefile.cvs command
      **** Tip ****
      If you encounter problems with this command click here. Krusader provides
      two nightly builds (snapshots) one with a ./configure script and one
      without.
   9. Your Linux® distro Krusader RPM or DEB package will normally install
      Krusader in the KDEDIR/bin directory. According to the Filesystem
      Hierarchy_Standard_(FHS), any user installed files go to the /usr/local
      directory. If you wish Krusader to be installed in another directory, it
      can be determed with the prefix option. If you do not have root access, /
      home/YOUR_USERNAME/.kde is probably a good choice.

      Thank you for using Krusader

      Good - your configure finished. Start make now
      bash$
      This is the output for Mandrake&#8482;-Linux® 10, other distributions may
      give a different output.
      **** Tip ****
      At the end of the ./configure script you will find a summary of the most
      important settings, e.g. where the Krusader binary will be installed
      (after the 'make install' command). This part will also display a warning
      if the environment variables KDEDIR_-_QTDIR are empty.
      Since Krusader-1.70.0 ./configure has two specific Krusader options:
          * ./configure --without-konqueror: build Krusader without support
            Konqueror's servicemenus, default=with. This means that Konqueror's
            right-click menu entries will not be available.
          * ./configure --without-javascript: build Krusader without JavaScript
            support, default=with. This means that the JavaScript_console will
            not be available.
          * ./configure --without-acl: build Krusader without ACL support
            default=with. Sometimes this option is needed if you get a ACL
            compile error when running make.
      In the past the support was always compiled in when the headers where
      found, now you have the choice.
      Use ./configure --helpto see more options or read the INSTALL file in the
      Krusader sources.
      If you used another --prefix= than $KDEDIR or /usr/local, it is
      recommended to do an extra check:
      $ kde-config --path exe
      /home/frank/.kde/bin/:/usr/bin/:/usr/local/bin/
      $
      If the <prefix_dir/bin> directory is not shown, you need to use e.g.
      export KDEDIRS=/usr/local:/usr. To make these settings permanent you can
      e.g. append this export command to your /etc/profile file. After that you
      need to restart KDE.
      **** Note ****
      If ./configure fails, take a look at FAQ_missing_libs_or_headers.
  10. Start the compilation process with the make command.
      $ make
      This will take about 3 - 40 minutes depending on how fast your computer
      runs. If everything goes well, it will e.g. end with the following
      messages:
      foo
      make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/source/krusader_kde3/tar'

Installing on Mac® OS-X
**** Note ****
Since June 2006 Krusader is added into the Krusader_finkproject.org_repository
Please check this url for the latest information about the Mac® OS-X port,
please read the fink documentation for more information, all information below
could be outdated, though they should still work :) From now on the port is
maintained by Catalin_Hritcu.
Krusader is ported to Mac® OS thanks the fink-project and Jonas Bähr and Bodo
Tasche . Unfortunately the only *stable* kdelib-binaries which fink has to
offer is currenly 3.1.4 which means you need to use Krusader-1.40 .
Unfortunately the Mac® OS X Krusader port does not have the same power as in a
native Linux®-KDE environment. To run Krusader you need also X11, which doesn't
interact with the rest of the Mac® OS desktop. We hope that Qt&#8482;4/KDE4
will solve most of these problems. If you want a more recent Krusader version
you need to compile KDE. With fink it is rather easy but it takes some CPU
cycles.
Installation Instructions for Krusader-1.40
   1. Download and install fink with the KDE3.1 binaries provided by fink and
      read the documentation.
   2. Extract the krusader-1.40.fink.darwin-ppc.tar.bz2 package to /sw/fink/
      dist/local/main/ Only root can write here. You may have to create 'local'
      and 'main'.
   3. Run as root: fink install krusader
Follow these instructions if you wish to compile more source code or use a more
recent version of Krusader:
   1. Install Apple®_X11
   2. Install the Apple®_X11_SDK developer-tools with X11 headers (gcc is
      included)
   3. Install the fink-base
   4. Compile kdelibs 3.4.1 or higher (fink provides the necessary .info files)
   5. Compile the Krusader-tarball or follow steps 2 and 3 of the previous
      section if a recent Krusader-package e.g. krusader-1.70.0.fink.darwin-
      ppc.tar.bz2 is available
Follow these instructions if you wish to compile Krusader-1.80.0 :
   1. Install Apple®_X11
   2. nstall fink and enable_fink_unstable.
   3. Compile and install the KDE bundle in fink: fink install bundle-kde-ssl
      (if you get &#8220;no package found&#8221; the previous step did not
      succeed).
   4. Use krusader.info (provided in the Krusader-sourcecode) and then copy to
      /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo .
   5. Compile and install Krusader in fink: fink install krusader
   6. Start X11 (startx) and in xterm run Krusader
Thanks to Catalin_Hritcu for these install instructions.
Starting Krusader
Type krusader (lower case) at a command prompt. You can create shortcut on your
desktop or create an entry in the (KDE) menu. Read the previous page and the
FAQ if Krusader doesn't start.
When Krusader is started from the command line, various options can be
specified to modify its behavior.
    	$ krusader
    	WARNING: Mt.Man: Born, looking around to get familiar. foo
**** Note ****
Do not worry about the messages you get in the Konsole. These messages are log
messages that can be used for debugging Krusader.
You can also use Alt+F2 to open the Run Command dialog box, type krusader
(lower case) and press Enter or click on the Run button.
If Krusader is installed by an RPM or DEB package then usually Krusader can be
started from the K menu. e.g. on Mandrake&#8482;-Linux® 10.0 click on the  [K]
icon button and choose Applications->File tools->Krusader.
Command-line options:
  --left <path>
      start left panel at <path>
  --right <path>
      start right panel at <path>
  --left <path1>,<path2>,<path3>
      start left panel at <path1>,<path2>,<path3>, with tabs.
  --profile <panel-profile>
      load a panel-profile on startup (this overrides the default_startup
      profile).
Examples:
$ krusader --left=<path> --right=<path>
$ krusader --left=/mnt/cdrom --right=ftp://downloads@myserver.net
$ krusader --left=<path1>,<path2> --right=<path1>,<path2>,<path3>
$ krusader--profile <panel-profile>
$ krusader --profile ftp-managment
The standard Qt&#8482; and KDE command-line options are available, and can be
listed by entering krusader --help.
Other command-line options:
  --help-qt
      List Qt-specific options
  --help-kde
      List KDE-specific options

The following text are generic installation instructions for KDE applications
(normally you will not need it). The following text is not written by us,
but is automaticly generated by Kdevelop.


Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
