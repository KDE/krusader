A Short Tutorial for the User Actions System
============================================
Go to the Konfigurator and choose "Useractions". There you manage all your
actions. If you add an new action, you get an empty input-mask where you can
enter all the properties. The action will be added as soon as you press "ok".
Now it's shown in the list on the left. 

You can choose it if you want to edit the properties (the changes will take 
effect if you press OK), remove it (per default you will be asked again if 
you realy want to delete it but you can disable it by checking "don't ask me again").

If you export a useraction you have to give a file where to store it. If it
does not exists it will be created. If it contains already some useractions,
the action you're exporting will be added to that file.

If you import some actions they will be added automaticly to your list. If
there are name-conflicts (the names have to be unique because these are the
ID for KDE's action-system) you're asked to resolve them. For this, the list on
the left will only show the actions where conflicts exists. You now can give
them new names or remove them.

All actions you've defined are now shown in the usermenu and in KDE's dialogs
for changing shortcuts and managing the toolbar. In addition all actions
which are available for the current item will also show up in the rightclick
menu.

The fields of the properties are  (* are required):
name*: a unique name of the action, used to identiy it for KDE's action-system
title*: the title displayed in the menus/dialogs
icon: the icon for you action
tooltip: a tooltip for your action - i.e. displayed in the toolbar on mouseover
desctiption: a description of what the action is doing.
command*: that is the command which is finaly executed. you can add
  placeholder using a GUI with the 'add'-button 
startpath: the working-directory for your command execution-mode should be clear
command eccepts: tells if the placeholder should return local addesses or URLs
Default shortcut: the action will be init with this shortcut

On the advanced-tab you can say where your command should be visible (for the
rightclick-menu). In addition it's possibe to change the command executed and 
confirm it separately. You can also set a user under which the command should 
be executed.

There are basicly two kinds of placeholders:
1) those who access internal functions of Krusader
2) those who are are replaced by a string.

it's important to know that the first category is performed at expansion-time,
meaning that the extra confirmation has only effect on programms which are
executed, not on internal functions (which aree called earlyer)

The list of placeholders is accessable via the 'add' button. 
Some Placeholders can get parameters, for those is also a GUI provided.
The following list is already implemented:
    Path       replaced by the panels path
    Count      replaced by the number of <first parameter>
    Filter     replaced by the panels filter-mask
    Current    replaced by the current item
    List       replaced by a list of all <first paremeter>
    Select     manipulates the selection in a panel
    Goto       changes the panels's path to <first parameter>
    Ask        asks the user for a some text and is replaced by the answer
    Clipboard  manipulates the clipboard
    Copy       copies a file, useful for quick, local, backups
    Sync       opens the Synchronizer with a given profile
    NewSearch  opens the search-windows with a given profile
    Profile    loads a given panel-profile
    
Enjoy,
