  <para>Welcome to &krusader;'s powerful search module -
  nicknamed KruSearcher. It is the most able tool (that we know of)
  for &Linux;, since it allows so many different ways to
  quickly find the file you are looking for. The search function is
  also available on remote file systems. It is divided into two
  levels, the general and the advanced. Let's take a look at the
  general page.</para>

  <para>The page is divided into four parts: top (search for) part,
  bottom part - titled <guilabel>Containing text</guilabel>,
  left part - titled <guilabel>Search in</guilabel> and right part
  which is called <guilabel>Do not search in</guilabel>.
  Obviously, each part handles different aspects of the search.
  Let's look at them closely.</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <title>Top Part:</title>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Search for</guilabel>: here you enter the main
      search criteria. You can enter a file name, a wildcard (
      <literal role="extension">*.o.*</literal>, 
      <literal role="extension">*.c</literal> &etc;) or
      both - separated by a space. If you type 
      <literal>'text'</literal> the results is the same as 
      <literal>'*text*'</literal>. You can exclude files from the
      search with '|' (&eg; 
      <literal role="extension">'*.cpp *.h |
      *.moc.cpp'</literal>) . You can use quotation marks for names
            that contain spaces. Filter "Program Files" searches
            out those files/directories the name of which is <filename>Program
            Files</filename>.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Case sensitive</guilabel>: unchecking it will allow
      lower and upper case search (&ie;:
      <literal role="extension">*.c</literal> interprets as 
      <literal role="extension">*.c</literal> AND 
      <literal role="extension">*.C</literal>).</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Of type</guilabel>: this box lets you search for a
      file not only by its name, but also by its MIME type. For
      example, you can search for all the audio files whose name
      begins with B. Usually this option defaults to 'all files',
      but you can choose to search for archives, directories,
      images, text files, videos and audio files.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <itemizedlist>
    <title>Left and Right Part:</title>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Search in</guilabel> and 
      <guilabel>Do not search in</guilabel>: Using those two parts,
      you can specify a search exactly the way you want it. For
      example, you might want to search for a file in the whole
      file system (beginning with 
      <filename>/</filename>), but do not want to search inside 
      <filename>/mnt</filename>. All you need to do is write 
      <filename>/</filename> in the 
      <guilabel>Search in</guilabel> box, and write 
      <filename>/mnt</filename> in the 
      <guilabel>Do not search in</guilabel> box. If you want to enter
      more than one directory in one of the list boxes, just type the
      first name and press &Enter;. The directory name
      will be copied to the bigger list box and you will be able to enter
      another name. 
      <note>
        <para>The input line has an auto-completion feature,
        corresponding to &kde; global settings. If you
        wish, you can click on the 
        <guiicon>folder icon</guiicon>, and browse to the directory
        you wish to add.</para>
      </note></para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <itemizedlist>
    <title>Bottom Part:</title>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Text</guilabel>: entering text here makes
      &krusader; search for it inside the files (
      <command>grep</command>). This way you can search for all
      header files (
      <literal role="extension">*.h</literal>) which include the
      word 
      <literal>'testing 123'</literal>.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <guilabel>Match whole word only</guilabel>
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Case sensitive</guilabel>: refers to your text
      being searched for in upper and lower case or the exact
      phrase you entered.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Search in subdirectories</guilabel>: perform a
      recursive search and dive into every directory on the
      way.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Search in archives</guilabel>:
      &krusader; will search for your files inside every
      supported archive. This, however, takes longer to perform. 
      <note>
        <para>If you check this checkbox, you will notice you cannot 
        <command>grep</command> inside files anymore. This is done,
        since looking inside archived files forces
        &krusader; to extract them, which results in an
        extremely time-consuming search.</para>
      </note></para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Follow links</guilabel>: if checked,
      &krusader; will follow soft-links during the
      search.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Profiles</guilabel>: if you have to regularly
      perform the same search operation, you can save the search
      settings &eg; include files, exclude files,
      &etc;... Press the 'profile' button, and you can
      add/load/save/remove search profiles.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>The above screen shot shows a search for all the files which
  end with 
  <literal role="extension">c, cpp</literal> or 
  <literal role="extension">h</literal> and include the string 
  <literal>'testing 123'</literal>. &krusader; will
  search in 
  <filename class="directory">/root, /opt, /bin</filename> and 
  <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>, but not in 
  <filename class="directory">/usr/lib</filename> and 
  <filename class="directory">/usr/share</filename>.</para>
  <para>Clicking the 
  <guibutton>Search</guibutton> button starts the search and
  displays the results page. During the search, you may press the 
  <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button to stop the search. The 
  <guibutton>Close</guibutton> button is not operational during a
  search, so you must first stop the search and then 
  <guibutton>Close</guibutton> the window. When a result is found,
  double-clicking on it will take &krusader;'s active
  panel point to the found files - but will not close the search
  window, so you will be able to click on a different result.</para>
  <para>Sometimes, you need to narrow your search even more.
  Krusearcher allows a much finer search, and for that, let's look
  at the 
  <guilabel>Advanced Page</guilabel>...</para>

  <para>This screen shot shows a search for files whose size is
  between 10KB and 150KB, which were modified between October 10th
  and November 1st, which belong to any user in the 'users' group,
  and are readable and writable by anyone in the 'users' group, but
  only readable to the rest of the world.</para>
  <para>The advanced page is divided into three parts: size, date
  and ownership.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Size</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>Allows you to choose the size range of the file you are
  looking for. By checking the check boxes, you can search for a
  file which is bigger than XXX bytes (or KB, MB), smaller than XXX
  bytes or, by checking both search for a file which size is bigger
  than XXX but smaller than YYY.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Date</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>This part offers three different ways of defining a date
  criteria: 
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Modified between</guilabel>: allows you to enter
      two dates. &krusader; will search for files with a
      modification date between the first date and the second one,
      inclusive. 
      <note>
        <para>You can click on the date icon (near the input boxes)
        to open a standard date window - which allows you to easily
        browse through the calendar and search for the desired
        date. Clicking on a date will close the window and the date
        will appear in the input box.</para>
      </note></para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Not modified after</guilabel>: choosing this option
      makes &krusader; search for files that were NOT
      modified after a given date, which is the same as searching
      for files older than that date.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Modified in the last/not modified in the
      last</guilabel>: in these input boxes, you do not enter a date
      but a number. This number represents days/weeks/months (as
      chosen in the near drop box). Entering the number 5 in the
      upper input box, makes &krusader; search for files
      that were modified in the last 5 days. Entering the number 2
      in the lower input box makes &krusader; search for
      files that did NOT change in the last 2 days. The combination
      of both results in a search for files that were changed in
      the last 5 days, but NOT in the last 2 days.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist></para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Ownership</emphasis>
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Belongs to user/group</guilabel>: by checking each
      of the corresponding check boxes, you can search for files
      which belong to a certain user and/or group. The drop box
      lists all the user names and group names in the system, just
      choose one and go ahead.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <guilabel>Permissions</guilabel>: divided into owner, group
      and all - it allows you to choose certain permissions for the
      file. You can choose to specify permissions for the owner,
      group, all or any combination. The question mark (?) is a
      wildcard - which means that any permission is valid.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <note>
    <para>To clarify, the screen shot above (the ownership part)
    describes a search for files that belong to any user in group
    'users', are readable, writable but not executable to any user
    in the group, are readable but not writable or executable to
    the rest of the world and have unknown permissions to its
    owner.</para>
  </note>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Results</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>Clicking on the 
  <guibutton>Search</guibutton> button to start the search and open
  the Results window. Here you can see the progress and the
  results of the search action. If you want you can stop the
  current search action with the 
  <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button. In the result list select the
  file and use 
  <keycap>F3</keycap>/
  <keycap>F4</keycap> to view/edit or use the right-click menu. When
  you click on a found item, the directory of the active panel will
  change if the selected item is not in the current panel
  directory. The results window supports dragging items to other windows 
  and copy to clipboard (<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>).
  When you close the Krusearcher window, the selected
  item is selected in the active panel.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Feed to listbox</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>When you click the 
  <guibutton>Feed to listbox</guibutton> button after the results
  are displayed, then &krusader; ask for a Query Name,
  this name will be used in the Results-Tab in the List Panel that
  holds the search results. You can do whatever you want on the
  files in the new tab. The location toolbar will display
  &eg; 
  <filename>virt:/Search results 1</filename>.</para>
  <warning>
    <para>The files in the Results-Tab are actually the original
    files. if you delete a file - it is removed!</para>
