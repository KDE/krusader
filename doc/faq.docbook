        <question id="faqi_kdelibs">
          <para>Does &krusader; need &kde; to
          run?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
          <emphasis>No, &krusader; does not need the
          &kde; window manager</emphasis> to run on your
          computer but &krusader;'s natural environment
          is &kde;, because it relies on services
          provided by the &kde; base libraries. Only
          some shared libraries are needed &eg;
          &kde; libraries, &Qt; libraries,
          &etc; This means that &krusader;
          runs on <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org"><application>GNOME</application></ulink>,
          <ulink url="http://www.afterstep.org/"><application>AfterStep</application></ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.xfce.org/"><application>XFce</application></ulink> and
          other window managers provided the appropriate libraries
          are installed on your computer. All this is not a problem
          since the apt-get world can resolve these dependencies
          instantly.</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>You do not need to switch to the &kde;
          window manager to use &krusader;; you can
          still use <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org"><application>GNOME</application></ulink>,
          <ulink url="http://www.afterstep.org/"><application>AfterStep</application></ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.xfce.org/"><application>XFce</application></ulink> or
          another window manager. However, the configuration of the
          &krusader; fonts and some behavior is done by
          running 
          <command>systemsettings</command>.</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>A lot depends on what you want to do with
          &krusader;. You should know that
          &krusader; uses the &kde;
          KIO Slaves to access remote file
          systems, and support for only a limited number of file
          system types are shipped with &kde; libraries,
          most of the KIO Slave are bundled with
          &kde; base (including fish, sftp and tar).
          However, if you want the property-dialog to show
          EXIF-data for .jpeg's, you need &kde;graphics.
          If you want ID3-infos, you need
          &kde;multimedia, and so on.</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>To summarize, if you want a working
          &krusader; - install &kde;libs. If
          you want a functional &krusader; then you need
          &kde;libs + &kde;base. For maximum
          functionality, &krusader; needs all of the
          &kde; package libraries, but the
          &kde; window manager is optional.</para>

          <para>Which libraries does &krusader; need to
          run?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>For running &krusader; (&eg;
          when you have installed &krusader; with a
          binary RPM) you need less libraries than if you compile
          &krusader; from source. &eg; you
          only need the C-compiler &gcc; when you
          compile &krusader; from source (see the next
          question).</para>
          <para>Take a look at the <link linkend="compilation">Krusader dependencies</link> paragraph  of our install chapter.</para>

          or headers. What do I need to do?</para>

          <para>Install the missing packages.</para>
          <para>Take a look at the <link linkend="compilation">Compilation requirements</link> paragraph  of our install chapter.</para>
          <para>Most RPM-based distributions separate the headers
          from the libs. The headers are needed to compile
          &krusader;. Look for packages in the form
          foo-devel-*.rpm (&eg; 
          <filename>kdelibs-devel-foo.i586.rpm</filename>) or
          foo-dev-*.deb for <trademark class="registered">Debian</trademark> based
          distributions. These are usually included with your
          distribution. 
          <tip>
            <para>If you cannot find the needed package, use
            <ulink url="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=krusader&amp;submit=Search+...">rpmfind</ulink> and click 'missing lib or
            header' in the search line. Or use 
            <command>apt-cache search 
            <replaceable>foo</replaceable></command> to find the
            corresponding package for <trademark class="registered">Debian</trademark> based

          <para>I'm trying to install binary foo (RPM or DEB
          package), but it fails. What's wrong?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Since we only prepare (and use) the source, we have
          no way of knowing this. Did you test the binary RPM
          before installing? 
          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>rpm</command> <option>-i --test</option> <replaceable>&lt;/path/to/rpmfile&gt; krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm</replaceable></userinput></screen> 
          If the prompt returns without any message, then
          everything is OK. RPM's downloaded from our website are
          usually provided by &krusader; users. Visit
          your distro website and search for an updated RPM.</para>
          <para>If the RPM is not OK, try to find another package
          at &Linux; software archives such as
          <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net/projects/krusader/">freshmeat.net</ulink> or <ulink url="http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=10214">KDE-APPS.org</ulink>.
          If you still cannot find the appropriate package for your
          &Linux; distribution, we recommend searching
          for it with <ulink url="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=krusader&amp;submit=Search+...">rpmfind</ulink> or
          <ulink url="http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/3/search/krusader">rpmpbone</ulink>.</para>
          <para>In general, a package for an older version of your
          distribution or even for another distribution might work
          on your computer (&eg; FC RPM's often work on
          Mdk and RH, and vice versa), but it is always the best
          that you install only RPM's that exactly match your
          distribution. If you cannot find a package that matches
          your distribution version, architecture or distribution,
          then use a source RPM. When you use a source RPM, the
          Krusader sources will be built, on your computer,
          guaranteeing a suitable binary RPM for your specific
          distribution and architecture. In addition, this method
          results in maximum system speed, since the resulting
          binary is customized for your computer. Please read the
          previous question, it explains how to install a source
          RPM. The best solution is explained in the next
          question.</para>

          <para>Check if your distribution provides

          &krusader; from source. Even if you feel you
          haven't got the necessary skills, you will probably
          succeed in compiling &krusader;: we provide a
          very detailed installation procedure. This HowTo enables
          newcomers to compile &krusader; from source,
          even if they have never done a compilation from source

          <guimenu>"Help"</guimenu> menu appears. Why?</para>

        <answer>
          <para>In this case only the

          items like &eg; 
          <guimenu>File</guimenu> and 
          <guimenu>Select</guimenu> are missing. This is because
          some distributions put the 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file in the wrong
          directory. To solve the problem, just copy the 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file from the package 
          <filename>
          krusader_kde3/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> to

          <filename>
          ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> and
          re-run &krusader;. If you have compiled
          &krusader; from sources this is often caused
          if the <envar>KDEDIR</envar> - <envar>QTDIR</envar> environment variables
          are not correctly set. The result is that the 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file is installed in
          the wrong directory. Please read the following question,

          ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> with
          the newer version when starting the new

          <para>If you install a CVS or beta version and
          &krusader; was already installed on your

        <question id="faqi_nvidia">
          <para>I have a 
          <filename>libGLcore.so.1</filename> compile error after
          using the <trademark class="registered">NVIDIA</trademark> installer, what to
          do?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>This problem occurs when you use the
          <trademark class="registered">NVIDIA</trademark> installer and not the official
          <trademark class="registered">NVIDIA</trademark> packages of your distribution.
          &krusader; is based on &Qt; which
          can be linked against the X OpenGL libraries. As a result
          &krusader; may look for OpenGL as well. The
          problem is that the <trademark class="registered">NVIDIA</trademark> installer (prior
          to version 7xxx) doesn't perform it's task properly: it
          replaces the OpenGL header files (which get included into
          &krusader;) but doesn't set the libGL links
          correctly. The best solution is to use the
          <trademark class="registered">NVIDIA</trademark> packages provided by your distributor
          or a new <trademark class="registered">NVIDIA</trademark> installer, the current
          version at the moment of writing is 7114. If, for some
          reason, you must use an old <trademark class="registered">NVIDIA</trademark> driver,
          one solution is the following hack, the exact commands
          depend on the distribution used and the version of the
          <trademark class="registered">NVIDIA</trademark> driver (6111 in this example), but it
          should read something like this:

          supermount, what's this about?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Supermount is a daemon which handles the
          mounting/unmounting of removable file systems for you.
          Just insert a floppy, and do 
          <userinput>
            <command>cd</command>
            <option>
              <replaceable>/mnt/floppy</replaceable>
            </option>
          </userinput>supermount will do the mount for you
          automatically and transparently. Usually this works fine.
          However, supermount misleads the system into thinking
          that the 
          <hardware>floppy/cdrom</hardware> is mounted at all times!
          This creates some problems for &krusader;, as
          it cannot really know when the floppy or CD has been
          removed because the system information is not correctly
          updated by supermount - is there really a 
          <hardware>floppy</hardware> in the 
          <hardware>drive</hardware>? Of course, this can be
          solved, but as for now, we don't consider it a
          priority.</para>

          dead mountpoint?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>When &krusader; is &eg;
          browsing an NFS share and the NFS server goes down,
          &krusader; will freeze. This
          &krusader; (and all other open internal
          viewers/editors) freeze is fatal, and can only be
          corrected with the 
          <command>kill -9</command>. We have no solution for this.
          This is an issue not confined to file managers, or even
          the &Linux; OS! The problem is that you "hang"
          on the first access to the dead share - so there is no
          way around it, no check to avoid it, even 
          <command>ls</command> will freeze. Just trying to read
          something - anything - is enough to get you stuck. The
          one and only way around this architectural problem is
          using a multi-threaded design - this way if we get stuck,
          we don't hang the entire application event loop, but we
          don't think that the time is right for adding threads, we
          are not sure that *all* the &kde; systems out
          there are using &Qt;-mt (the multi threaded
          version of the &Qt; library), and the Krusader
          Krew may not be the right people to address this major
          issue in any case; so currently this is just a bug we
          have to learn to live with.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>See the

          They are not allowing &krusader; to downsize

          and you'll be able to resize

          we have improved this greatly: when downsizing the
          buttons will look like 'F5 ..py'. When the button faces
          are too small to read a tooltip will give the complete
          text. The minimum width is 45 pixels for each

  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>Krusader uses several programs as <link linkend="konfig-dependencies">external tools</link>, 
        and sometimes they appear not to work.
        
       Open a terminal and check if tool foo is installed.
       <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>foo</command></userinput></screen> 

       Check if tool foo is properly configured in the <link linkend="konfig-dependencies">Konfigurator Dependencies page</link>.

       For Archiving tools: autodetect the archives again with the <guibutton>Auto Configure</guibutton> button
       in the <link linkend="konfig-archives">Konfigurator archive page</link>. 
       
       Check the <link linkend="konfig-protocols">Konfigurator Protocol page</link>
   
     If it doesn't work, backup your <filename>~/.kde/share/config/krusaderrc</filename> configuration file and remove it from this location.
     Restart Krusader, Krusader will now start the first start configuration wizard, follow these guidelines.

        <answer>
          <para>This problem often occurs when you are behind a

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>When uploading files a <filename>.part</filename> suffix is added to the filename,
                once the upload is complete the filename is renamed automagically 
                to remove the <filename>.part</filename> suffix.
                This works great but sometimes some ftp-servers don't allow a rename operation.
                You can solve this by unchecking the checkbox

              code snipped does not diff. In the past, patch mails went lost or disorganized in many many mails,

              differs from, let's say a wiki: a software project
              has to have someone to make all the final decisions.

              keep in mind that the examination of patches might

  <question id="faqg_valgrint">
  <para>How can i send good debug or crash reports?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>Usually binary packages that are been used by your distribution do not contain debug information.
        Since we usually only develop and fix &krusader;-cvs, compile &krusader;-cvs in debugmode and install it, than check if the bug still exist.
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>cmake</command> <option>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull</option></userinput></screen>  

        Install <ulink url="http://valgrind.org">valgrind</ulink>, a suite of tools for debugging and profiling &Linux; programs.

        Run Valgrind/&krusader;
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>valgrind</command> <option>--tool=memcheck</option> <replaceable>{foo_path}/krusader</replaceable></userinput></screen>
        
        The valgrind tool will write to stdout, what really happens.
        If you could send these information before the crash, it's almost sure, that we may fix or tell you what to do.

  <question id="faqg_crashhandler">
  <para>What to do if the KDEcrashhandler sends no useful backtrace information?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>Usually binary packages that are been used by your distribution do not contain debug information.
        Since we usually only develop and fix &krusader;-cvs, compile &krusader;-cvs in debugmode and install it, than check if the bug still exist.
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>cmake</command> <option>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull</option></userinput></screen> 
 
       If the KDEKrashhandler still doesn't provide useful backtrace information, than sometimes a coredump will give better information. 
       Run Krusader, with disabled crashhandler.
       <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>krusader</command> <option>--nocrashhandler</option></userinput></screen>

       On a crash you will get a <filename>.core</filename> file, usually in your home directory.

       Run <ulink url="http://sourceware.org/gdb/">gdb</ulink>, the GNU Project Debugger
       
       <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>gdb</command> <option>-c</option> <replaceable>corefile krusader</replaceable></userinput></screen>
       
       Now type <command>bt</command> to get the backtrace and type <command>q</command> to quit gdb.

       Often the best debug results will be given when using the valgrind tool.
