  <para>MountMan is a tool which helps you manage your mounted file systems. Once
  invoked, it displays a list of every mounted file system. For each file system,
  MountMan displays its name (which is the actual device name - &ie; <filename
  class="directory">/dev/sda1</filename> for a first partition on first
  <hardware>HDD</hardware>), its type (ext4, ext3, ntfs, vfat, ReiserFS...)
  and its mount point on your system (the directory on which the file system
  is mounted).</para>
  <para>If you want filter out non-removable devices from the list,
  just check the item <guilabel>Show only removable devices</guilabel>
  at the left of the device list.

  <para>MountMan also displays usage information using total size,
  free size, and percentage of available space free. If those
  numbers say 
  <guilabel>N/A</guilabel>, that usually means that the file system
  is not mounted. Left clicking on a file system displays a pie chart
  on the left of the window, graphically displaying the usage
  information for the file system. Clicking on a non-mounted
  file system will display 
  <guilabel>not mounted</guilabel> instead of the graph.</para>

      <para>
      <keycap>Right-clicking</keycap> on a file system will open a
      small menu which displays what actions can be performed on
      that file system. At the moment, you can only mount, unmount
      and eject (if clicking on a removable file system, &eg;, a 
      &CD-ROM;).</para>

  <note>
    <para>We plan to expand MountMan in the next evolution of &krusader;. It will be able
    to format partitions, edit <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>,
    create new file systems and more.... By the way, we have started working on it,
    see "Quickmode for MountMan".</para>

  <para>To activate Quickmode for MountMan, click lateral button with arrow on the
  MountMan button on the <link linkend="mainwindow">Main Toolbar</link>.</para>
  <para>General idea: display a list of all possible mount points.
  Each time the menu is displayed, it determines if a mount point is
  mounted or not and associates the correct action (mount or
  umount). This offers a quick interface to MountMan. It is
  working, and currently uses KMountMan::mount and unmount. It uses
  the new &kde; services for fstab-reading and this will
  enable us to remove a lot of code from the "old" MountMan.</para>
