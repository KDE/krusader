New feature: support for tar.lzma (KDE's tar protocol doesn't support it yet)
http://www.krusader.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=2032
http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176881

New feature: Possibility to choose one of 5 methods of sorting in the panel.
   Konfigurator->Look&Feel->Panel
   - Alphabetical - strings are compared character by character
        (no context rules from locale applied). Alphabet characters are
         compared using locale rules, special characters are compared by
         the character code.
   - Alphabetical with numbers - the same, but if the names contains numbers
         the numbers are compared numerically instead of alphabetically.
   - Character code - comparison by character code - quick.
   - Character code and numbers - the same with numerical comparison of numbers
   - Krusader (default) - the comparison used so far. Uses comparison using
         locale rules (even context rules). Only if the sorting is set to be
         case sensitive and the current locale compares case insensitive,
         compares by character code (?).
   Thanks Jacek Jaworski who suggested a patch.

New feature: Queue manager
             Use F5 (copy) or F6 (move) and than F2 to use it.
             Or the direct shortcuts: copy by queue (SHIFT+F5), move by queue (SHIFT+F6).
             Queueing is used for one-by-one copying.
             E.g. if you have a pen drive (which is slow), and you want to copy 40 files
             onto it, it's much better copying them one-by-one instead of starting to copy
             40 files parallelly. That's why enqueuing is important.
             If you pack/unpack 40 files parallelly, you overload your computer,
             but adding them to a queue (which is not yet implemented into Krusader),
             is much more useful.
             http://www.krusader.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=810

-------------------------------- 2.0.0-beta1 ---------------------------

New feature: Krusader is able to send e-mails by thunderbird
   - one can set up thunderbird as an e-mail sender in the dependencies
   - from now more than one file can be sent in an attachment

New feature: for content searching (searcher, advanced selection,
    synchronizer), the content encoding can be given.

New feature: select remote encoding for krarc
  - the file name encoding for zip, rar, arj, lha can be set from now
  - as 7z always uses UTF-16, remote encoding will not work for 7z
  - it's imporant because zip files that were created on Windows can
    have different encoding

New feature: new synchronizer shortcuts
  - CTRL + W : reverse direction
  - ALT + Down : exclude
  - ALT + Up : restore original task
  - ALT + Left : copy to left
  - ALT + Right : copy to right
  - ALT + Delete : mark for delete


-------------------------------- 1.80.0 --------------------------------
UserActions: Expander: Many fixes, better error handling, sensible
  %_Each&-handling. Finally I managed to implement Jiri's 100k patch for
  the useractions. This patch handles the Each-placeholder much better
  (i.e. allows Each inside Copy and can deal with multiple Each's) and
  provides a good base for future extensions. Thanks a lot!

New feature: atomic extension. 
  - Extensions known to be atomic (like tar.gz) are now handled properly
    both in the panel and during rename. The list of atomic extensions
    can be provided through "Atomic Extensions" in [Look&Feel] in
    krusaderrc.

New feature: rename just the filename, without extension
  - in the look&feel page, disable "rename selects extension", and then,
    when you rename a file, only the filename will be selected, but not
    the extension

New feature: full screen terminal (mc style)
  - if enabled in look&feel, pressing the required shortcut to show
    the terminal emulator will hide all of krusader, just like midnight
    commander.

New feature: right click menu for bookmarks
  - after right clicking on a bookmark, a popup menu appears with
  
      Open
      Open in new tab
      Delete

    menu items.

New feature: enable/disable the special bookmarks
  - right click on a special bookmark
    (Popular URLs, Devices, Local Network, Virtual Filesystem, Jumb
    back, Set jump back, Bookmark Current or Manage Bookmarks)
  - a new rightclick menu appears containing the special bookmark items
    if a menu item is checked then the bookmark is enabled
  - one can enable/disable separately the following special bookmarks
      - the "Popular URLs" bookmark
      - the "Devices" bookmark
      - the "Local Network" bookmark
      - the "Virtual Filesystem"
      - the "Jump back" and "Set jump back" bookmarks

New feature: keeping the directory structure of copying/moving from
             virtual folders
  - assume we have 3 URL-s in a virtual subfolder
    /home/myhome/mydir1/myfile1
    /home/myhome/mydir1/myfile2
    /home/myhome/mydir2/myfile3
  - in the destination folder we would like to get:
    mydir1/myfile1
    mydir1/myfile2
    mydir2/myfile3
  - Just press F5 for copy (dialog appears)
    source MUST be a virtual subfolder!
    target MUST NOT be a virtual folder!
  - in the dialog, there's a new option:
    "Keep virtual directory structure"
  - check it
  - select /home/myhome/ for base URL
  - start the copy / move

  - AND: the directory structure will be kept at copying!
    that's it! :-)

New option in look&feel: directories are always sorted by name

Big cleanup in the UserAction module:
  - dropped support of "same_as"-attribute in the description-tag
  - dropped need for a manual name-conflict-resolution, now a nummer is
    append on double names
  - reduced the memory-consumption drasticly due to internal changes
  - added copy actions to clipboard / past actions from clipboard
  - multiselection for export/remove/copy
  - renamed the actionfile we provide to useraction_examples.xml,
    so that we can merge new examples with existing installations
  - on export one can now choose between overwrite and merge is the
    file already exists and contains useractions
  - Actions are now manages with ActionMan; the list is now a
    categorized tree with icon and title instead of the identifyer.
  - On the UserAction page in Konfigurator you can now change the
    Terminal for UserActions and the font for the output-collection.

New archive handling:
  supports passworded arj, ace, rar, zip
  step into hidden archives by pressing <RIGHT> on the archive
  decompressing debian packages by Alt+U
  using KWallet to store the passwords
  writes out the error messages of the archiver
  archive type autodetection by its header (first 512 byte)

-------------------------------- 1.70.0 --------------------------------

New global calculate space function:
  Used to calculate occupied space inside archives remote FS and in
  virtual VFS need KDE >= 3.3
  for local FS the old (and faster) code is still used.

New zip/tar slave - based on KDE's but support writing to archive
  Modified KDE tar slave (which also handle ZIP archives) to support
  writing. Compared to kr_arc:
  Pros: Speed. No need for external binary. Speed. did I mentioned
  speed?
  Cons: does not support delete from archive.
  (You need to change the protocol registration to use this slave)

New configure-switches:
  --without-konqueror - builds Krusader without Konqueror's servicemenus
  --without-javascript - builds Krusader without JS support
  In the past the support was always compiled in when the headers where
  found.

Jump-Back:
  If you create a new tab the startup-path is saved. You can now step
  deep into the dir-tree and Ctrl-J brings you back to your starting
  position. It's also possible to set the current directory manually as
  Jump-Back-Point.

-------------------------------- 1.60.0 --------------------------------

Useraction: new placeholder: %_ListFile()%
  is replaced by path/filename of a temporary file containing a list of
  items usefull for external scripts

Custom Selection Mode

Popular Links - krusader's answer to google-ranking :-)
  In the bookmarks menu, you'll see a new submenu called "popular urls"
  From now on, krusader keeps track of every url you visit (also remote)
  and keeps a ranking for every url. the more you visit the url, the
  higher the ranking. clicking the popular links menu displays the top
  15 links sorted by popularity. the top is the most popular. this is
  easy for when u need to visit urls often, but don't want to create a
  bookmark. this is also a better "history" since unlike the 'history'
  button, this ranking accumulates urls from all tabs.

  also use the two-enter dialog:
  * open it
    (ctrl-z or bookmarks->popular urls->popular urls(bottom of list))
  * type few letter to narrow the search
  * hit enter (you'll go to the url list)
  * hit enter again and the panel is refreshed!
  

Virtual VFS.
  This is not a virtual folder !
  but more a container for URL's from different file system.
  just perfect for displaying search results and so on...
  Action you perform on the files in this VFS are performed on the
  'real' files. you don't just delete files from the VFS - you delete
  them from your hard drive.
  limitations:: you can't create directories inside a virtual VFS.

Primitive scripting support.
condition: KJSEmbed is installed (package: KDEbindings)
  Ctrl+Alt+J opens the JavaScript-console. There you can play around:
  try 'Krusader.setCaption("Hey Ho, Let's go!");',
  "Krusader.children();", "Krusader.child("help").slots();",
  "alert(Krusader.properties())" and "Krusader.child("help").show();"...
  In addition a new placeholder for the useraction,
  %_Script(path/to/script.js)% executes an external file.
  If the path is relative the file will be read from
  <KDE-app-data>/krusader/js/
  If a UserAction should execute the return of a script, set the second
  parameter of %_Script()% to "return=cmd".
  In this case the Variable 'cmd' will be read.
  additional the second parameter can be used to pass variables to the
  script:
  "return=lala;foo=bar". here the variable foo will have at the
  beginning of the execution the value 'bar' and the return-variable is
  called lala instead of cmd. Warning: very alpha!!

krusader has now a new toolbar: actions toolbar. you can show/hide it
using the view menu --> show actions toolbar. useful to put actions (and
later bookmarks), put in as a side toolbar with small icons. __you'll
have to overwrite krusaderui.rc__

color scheme can now be imported/exported. reacable in the colors page
in konfigurator

disk usage (tools menu + 3rd panel)

changing the coloumns by right clicking on the panel's header

Refresh-in-the-background: from now on, reading a remote url or
the contents of an archive is done in the background. this means
that krusader remains responsive and can be used to do whatever you need
in any other panel or tab.

useraction:new placeholder %_PanelSize%
  This placeholder can change the ration between the two panels.
  %aPanelSize("80")% makes the active panel use 80% of krusader's width
  (height in vertical-mode)
  ommiting the parameter means 50%

useraction: new placeholder: %_Each%
  This placeholder splitts the commandline into a list where
  %_Each(...)% is replaced by one
  list-item (all, all files, all dirs, all selected). These commands are
  executed one after another.

Full viewer in the 3rd hand (thanks to illissius)

Shift-DEL will delete a file and not move it to the trash as DEL does.
(total commander like)

Import/Export keyboard shortcuts from/to a file. want krusader to become
total commander in a single click? no problem!

Mouse selection modes is back! check out the Look'N'Feel section

-------------------------------- 1.51 ----------------------------------

The long awaited feature: Fn keys can be changed to different shortcuts

Total-commander refresh: when krusader isn't focused, it is not refreshed
at all.

Pressing ctrl-up arrow from the panel, jumps to the origin bar

-------------------------------- 1.50 ----------------------------------

Human-readable file sizes is implemented (located in look&feel->panel)

From now on, Konqueror's right click menu is imported to Krusader

Cut (ctrl+x), Copy (ctrl+c) and Paste (ctrl+v)
  are available. They even work with Konqueror.  Please test it.

Compare by content: you can now either:
  - select (mark) one file in the left panel, and one in the right panel
  - select exactly two files in the active panel
  - make sure there is a file in the other panel with the same name as
    the current file in the active panel

Panel profiles: now it is possible to store environment profiles.
  An environment profile contains the following:
  - all the tabs path (left / right)
  - the current tab   (left / right)
  - and the selected side (left or right)
  You can save / restore these tabulator profiles. Please test it.

  Those users who use the CVS version of Krusader, should delete the
  krusaderui.rc from their home directory, to make the new menu and
  toolbar items visible.
  (rm ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc)

Synchronizer:  now you can use the search filters in the synchronizer

Useraction:  removed placeholder 'Bookmark'. It is deprecated now since
the new bookmark-system can be accessed directly like a user action. If
you need it anyway, use 'Goto' instead.

TC like searching: if you type 'text' -> results the same as '*text*'
You can exclude files from the search with '|'
(ex. '*.cpp *.h | *.moc.cpp' )

Search is possible on remote file systems as well.

If you have filesystems that you don't want to accidentally unmount (or
mount), just go to Konfigurator->Advanced, and enter a list of mount
points separated by commas, for example: /, /boot, /tmp) and mountman
won't try to (un)mount them.

Mountman got a big nose-job ;-) please test it well.

You can now drag'n'drop to the new tree view

Shift+left/right changes tabs (thanks to Dmitry Suzdalev)

New vfs_refresh() function only updates changes when you re-read a panel
and changes the content without the annoying full redraw effect.

When closing Krusader, the tabs are saved and restored

Synchronizer profiles:
  Krusader handles synchronizer profiles. In synchronizer press
  the 'profile' button, and you'll be able to add / load / save / remove
  synchronizer profiles.

Synchronize with Kget:
  If you want to synchronize a local directory with an unstable ftp
  server, Kget is a much better solution than simple file copying. After
  comparing you may right click on the result list and select
  'Synchronize with kget' to execute the synchronization, after that the
  listed files will be downloaded with kget instead of Krusader.

Dropping URLs onto the status / totals line:
  If a directory contains a lot of subdirectories, it may not be
  possible to drop the URL onto the panel (on which only directories are
  visible). Now the URL can be dropped onto the status / totals line
  instead.

Sync-browsing:
  With a little toggle-button in the panel-level toolbar the SyncBrowse
  mode is activated/deactivated.
  When active, each directory change in the specific panel is performed
  in the other panel also.

User-Actions:
  With the user action system the user can make his own actions on files
  in the panel or access Krusader internal functions with parameters
  directly using the placeholder.
  The actions integrate seamless into KDE's action-system, so the
  standard edit-toolbar/shortcut-dialogs can show/manipulate the user
  actions, too. The user actions are stored in
  ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/useraction.xml (the file-structure is
  documented in doxygen-headers of UserActionXML) User Actions can be
  edited/added/im-/exported using a new Konfigurator module (although I
  plan to move all action-related to a new ActionMan. For more info, see
  http://www.jonas-baehr.de/forum/Krusader-ideas.txt)
  Currently, these placeholder are implemented (for details see
  UserAction/expander.cpp or doxygen):
    Path       replaced by the panels path
    Count      replaced by the number of <first parameter>
    Filter     replaced by the panels filter-mask
    Current    replaced by the current item
    List       replaced by a list of all <first paremeter>
    Select     manipulates the selection in a panel
    Goto       changes the panels's path to <first parameter>
    Ask        asks the user for a some text and is replaced by the
               answer
    Clipboard  manipulates the clipboard
    Copy       copies a file, useful for quick, local, backups
    Sync       opens the Synchronizer with a given profile
    NewSearch  opens the search-windows with a given profile
    Profile    loads a given panel-profile

  A GUI-based helper for placeholder-adding is provided.
  In Path, Current and List spaces are per default automaticly escaped.
