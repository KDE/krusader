    FIXED: integrated the openUrl() API.
    FIXED: minor bug in mountman
    FIXED: bug in arc_vfs, concerning full-paths in tars (thanks Heiner)
    FIXED: right align size column

  REMOVED: Tree & Quickview panels.


1.11 KDE 3
======================
    ADDED: updated Swedish translation, thanks to Anders Linden.
    ADDED: new Spanish translation, thanks to Rafa Munoz.
    ADDED: new Polish translation, thanks to Lukasz Janyst.

    FIXED: Changed the internal viewer default from Hex to Text.
    FIXED: Crash when Krusader is called with open viewer/internal editor.
    FIXED: Keyboard shortcuts not saved in Konfigurator.


1.10 - KDE 3
======================
    ADDED: new and improved viewer.
    ADDED: Krename support ! (more info at: http://krename.sf.net )
    ADDED: you can now use the command line to "cd" into konqi-supported urls.
           ( try: cd audiocd:/?dev=/dev/cdrom )
    ADDED: you can try to execute files in remote filesystem.
    ADDED: new command detection function instead of using 'which'

    FIXED: rewritten the panel sorting function, it should be better and faster
           now.
    FIXED: back to KRDirWatch, since KDirWatch crashed us on systems with FAM
           enabled.
    FIXED: removed the "panel start path is invalid" error message. if the
           start path is invalid try to find the closest path (the previous
           solution was '/');
    FIXED: don't watch read-only/not-readable directories - this should improve
           performance and avoid a loooong wait time on super-mounted cdroms.
    FIXED: multiple selctions modes are no-more. default mode is Konqueror.
           the multi-mode become unstable after the kde3 porting and we had to
           disable it.
    FIXED: memory leak when starting konfigurator.


1.0.2 - KDE 3
======================
    ADDED: new icon.
    ADDED: sftp & scp support.
    ADDED: multi-protocol and history to the new connection dialog.

    FIXED: normal_vfs now uses the KDE dir watch, in other words: better
           directory refresh.
    FIXED: new 'admin' folder.


1.0.1 - KDE 3
======================
    ADDED: Krusader now compiles on KDE 3 (tested with RC3).
    ADDED: New ftp/smb vfs due to KDE 3 API changes.


1.0.1
======================
    ADDED: When compare-mode is active, pressing the 'Select Files' icon (or the
           equivelent keyboard short-cut), will open the usual dialog with 4 new
           options in the predefined selections. This allows automatic selection
           of files according to their compare-mode status - newer, older, etc.
    ADDED: Terminal emulator now "follows mouse" - konqueror style.
    ADDED: French translation.
    ADDED: A new icon for Krusader. new we've got krusader.png and
           krusader2.png!

    FIXED: errors compiling on kde 2.1 - convertSizeFromKB
    FIXED: compatability issue with installing to debian
    FIXED: compatability issue with Solaris
    FIXED: keyboard settings are not saved.
    FIXED: a small bug causing 'rrr' to show instead of 'rwx'.
